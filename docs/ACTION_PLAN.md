# ðŸ”§ Action Plan v25.6.19

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

## Project Template

A base template to quickly and efficiently start software projects.

Manually configuring a project can be repetitive and error-prone. Thatâ€™s why this proposal offers a predefined structure with essential files, helping to optimize time and reduce possible mistakes.

## Tasks

The main purpose of this action plan is to provide a robust foundation that streamlines the creation of repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The goal is to simplify the initial setup, standardize processes, and promote best practices from the start of the project. The tasks to be executed are described below:
