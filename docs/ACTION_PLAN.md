# Action Plan

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

## Project Template v25.6.30

Base template to quickly and efficiently start software projects.

Setting up a project from scratch is often complex and repetitive, taking time away from actual development. This base template streamlines the initial setup in **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, allowing teams to focus on creating quality solutions from the start.

## Tasks

The main purpose of this action plan is to provide a **Base Project Template** with an organized structure and ready-to-use configuration for **GitHub** and **Visual Studio Code**. It simplifies the start-up process, reduces errors, and encourages best practices, allowing teams to focus on developing key features.
