## Project Template

Base template to start software projects quickly and efficiently.

Setting up a project from scratch is usually complex and repetitive, taking time away from actual development. This base template streamlines the initial setup on **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, allowing teams to focus on creating quality solutions from the start.

### Problem

When starting a project, teams often waste time on repetitive and error-prone configurations, detracting focus from developing key functionalities.

#### Key Problems

- **Inconsistent structure**: The absence of a standard structure makes code organization and comprehension difficult.
- **Redundant configurations**: Repeating the same configuration steps in each project increases the risk of errors and consumes unnecessary time.
- **Insufficient documentation**: The absence of clear and easily accessible guides makes learning, collaboration, and project maintenance difficult.
- **Limited tool integration**: Not having predefined configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code makes efficient code management and collaboration difficult.
- **Poor agile implementation**: Without adequate guidance, the adoption of agile methodologies like Kanban or Scrum becomes ineffective.
- **Limited AI utilization**: Not incorporating methodologies or tools like GitHub Copilot reduces the potential for automation, intelligent assistance, and continuous improvement in code quality.
- **Lack of automation**: Not having GitHub Actions to automate common tasks limits workflow efficiency.
- **Absence of code of conduct**: Not establishing coexistence standards can negatively affect the work environment and collaboration.
- **Disorganized collaboration**: The lack of clear processes to contribute and review code limits productivity and project quality.
- **Security and legal risks**: Not defining security policies or licenses can expose the project to vulnerabilities and legal issues.

### Solution

We offer a **Base Project Template** with organized structure and ready-to-use configuration for **GitHub** and **Visual Studio Code**. It simplifies startup, reduces errors, and promotes good practices, allowing teams to focus on developing key functionalities.

#### Key Solutions

- **Organized structure**: Predefined directories for efficient development.
- **Complete documentation**: Detailed guides for every aspect of the project.
- **GitHub configuration**: Integration with workflows like GitHub Flow.
- **VS Code configuration**: Recommended settings and extensions included.
- **Kanban methodology**: Integrated visual tracking system.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted development methodology.
- **GitHub Pages**: Online accessible documentation and guides.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automation of common tasks.
- **Code of Conduct**: Standards for a collaborative and respectful environment.
- **Collaboration**: Templates for contributions and clear policies.
- **Security**: Security policies and vulnerability reporting.
- **MIT License**: Free and open use under MIT license.

#### What it does NOT include

- Configuration for **programming languages**.
- Configuration for **other version control tools**.
- Configuration for **other IDEs or code editors**.
- Use of **specific agile methodologies**.

### Conclusion

This base template constitutes a comprehensive solution that facilitates starting projects efficiently, structured, and professionally. By implementing it, development teams will be able to optimize their time, minimize errors, and focus on creating innovative and high-quality solutions, thus driving project success from its early stages.
