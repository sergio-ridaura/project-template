## Project Template v25.6.29

A base template to start software projects quickly and efficiently.

Setting up a project from scratch is often complex and repetitive, taking time away from real development. This base template streamlines the initial setup in **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, allowing teams to focus on creating quality solutions from the start.

### Problem

When starting a project, teams often waste time on repetitive and error-prone configurations, losing focus on developing key features.

#### Key Problems

- **Inconsistent structure**: The lack of a standard structure makes code organization and understanding difficult.
- **Redundant configurations**: Repeating the same setup steps in every project increases the risk of errors and wastes unnecessary time.
- **Insufficient documentation**: The lack of clear guides complicates learning, collaboration, and project maintenance.
- **Limited tool integration**: Not having predefined configurations for GitHub and Visual Studio Code hinders efficient code management and collaboration.
- **Poor agile implementation**: Without proper guidance, adopting agile methodologies like Kanban or Scrum is less effective.
- **Limited AI utilization**: Not incorporating methodologies or tools like GitHub Copilot reduces the potential for automation, intelligent assistance, and continuous code quality improvement.
- **No code of conduct**: Not establishing rules of coexistence can negatively affect the work environment and collaboration.
- **Disorganized collaboration**: The lack of clear processes for contributing and reviewing code limits productivity and project quality.
- **Security and legal risks**: Not defining security policies or licenses can expose the project to vulnerabilities and legal issues.

### Solution

We offer a **Base Project Template** with an organized structure and ready-to-use configuration for **GitHub** and **Visual Studio Code**. It simplifies project setup, reduces errors, and encourages best practices, allowing teams to focus on developing key features.

#### Key Solutions

- **Organized structure**: Predefined directories for efficient development.
- **Complete documentation**: Detailed guides for every aspect of the project.
- **GitHub configuration**: Integration with workflows like GitHub Flow.
- **VS Code configuration**: Recommended settings and extensions included.
- **Kanban methodology**: Integrated visual tracking system.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted development methodology.
- **Code of Conduct**: Rules for a collaborative and respectful environment.
- **Collaboration**: Contribution templates and clear policies.
- **Security**: Security policies and vulnerability reporting.
- **MIT License**: Free and open use under the MIT license.

#### What is NOT included

- Configuration for **programming languages**.
- Configuration for **other version control tools**.
- Configuration for **other IDEs or code editors**.
- Use of **specific agile methodologies**.

### Conclusion

This base template is a comprehensive solution that facilitates the efficient, structured, and professional start of projects. By implementing it, development teams can optimize their time, minimize errors, and focus on creating innovative, high-quality solutions, thus driving project success from the
