## Introduction

Before drafting an action plan, adapt this guide to the needs and specific context of your project. If you are working in a team, review and adjust the guide together to ensure it reflects the objectives and expectations of all participants. If you are unsure how to start, use this document as an initial reference and adjust it as you progress in developing your plan.

The purpose of this guide is to help you structure and write action plans in a professional, clear, and effective manner. Here you will find practical recommendations and useful tips to improve the quality and effectiveness of your plans.

Not all actions must be carried out. The action plan is related to the project proposal and is a tool to assess the feasibility of the project. If, after analysis, it is determined that the project is not viable, it is essential to close the proposal professionally, clearly explaining the reasons and thanking the reader for their time and consideration.

## Action Plan Structure

To write an effective action plan, follow this basic structure that will help you organize the information clearly and coherently:

### 1. Copyright

Include a clear copyright line, specifying the year and the name of the author or authors of the action plan. You can add a link to your professional profile (for example, LinkedIn or GitHub) to provide more information about your experience. If the plan is prepared by a team, use the team name and provide a link to a shared document detailing the members and their roles in the project. This facilitates proper attribution and brings transparency to authorship.

### 2. Project Name

Indicate a clear and self-explanatory name for the project. Accompany it with a brief description summarizing its main purpose and the objective it seeks to achieve. Include the document version to facilitate its identification and tracking throughout the process.

### 3. Plan Summary

Write a concise and focused summary of the action plan, highlighting its main purpose and the value it brings to the project. Clearly describe the objective of the plan and how it relates to the project proposal. Whenever possible, support the information with data, concrete examples, or real situations to contextualize and emphasize the relevance of the plan.

### 4. Tasks

Describe the tasks that will be carried out to implement the project. Explain the activities, needs, or limitations faced by the team and how these negatively impact the execution of the project.

#### 4.1. Task

List the specific tasks to be addressed in the plan. Use **bold** to highlight each task and accompany each with a brief explanation.

### 5. Summary

Make an estimate of the number of tasks and efforts required to complete the project.
