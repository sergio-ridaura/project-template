## Introduction

Before drafting a project proposal, adapt this guide to the needs and context of your initiative. If you are working in a team, review and adjust the guide together to ensure it reflects the objectives and expectations of all participants. If you are unsure how to start, use this document as an initial reference and adjust it as you progress in developing your proposal.

The purpose of this guide is to help you structure and write project proposals in a professional, clear, and persuasive manner. Here you will find practical recommendations and useful tips to improve the quality and effectiveness of your proposals.

Not all proposals need to be carried out. The proposal is a tool to assess the feasibility of the project. If, after analysis, it is determined that it is not feasible, it is essential to close the proposal professionally, clearly explaining the reasons and thanking the reader for their time and consideration.

## Proposal Structure

To write an effective project proposal, follow this basic structure that will help you organize the information clearly and coherently:

### 1. Copyright

Include a clear copyright line, specifying the year and the name of the author(s) of the proposal. You can add a link to your professional profile (for example, LinkedIn or GitHub) to provide more information about your experience. If the proposal is prepared by a team, use the team name and provide a link to a shared document detailing the members and their roles in the project. This facilitates proper attribution and provides transparency about authorship.

### 2. Project Name

Indicate a clear and self-explanatory name for the project. Accompany it with a brief description summarizing its main purpose and the objective it seeks to achieve. Include the document version to facilitate its identification and tracking throughout the process. The title should accurately convey the project's purpose and allow for quick reference in future reviews.

### 3. Summary or Introduction

Write a concise and focused summary of the project, highlighting its main purpose and the value it brings to the target audience. Clearly describe the central problem faced by this audience, detailing the current challenges or limitations. Whenever possible, support the information with data, concrete examples, or real situations to contextualize and emphasize the project's relevance.

### 4. Problem

Clearly describe the main problem the project seeks to solve. Explain the difficulties, needs, or limitations faced by the target audience and how these negatively impact their current situation.

#### 4.1. Key Problems

List the specific problems addressed by the project. Use **bold** to highlight each problem and accompany each with a brief explanation. Limit the list to the most relevant problems to maintain focus and clarity.

### 5. Solution

Present the proposed solution to solve the identified problems. Detail how this solution adds value, improves the situation of the target audience, and how it differs from other existing alternatives.

#### 5.1. Key Solutions

List the main features of the solution. Highlight each feature in **bold** and briefly explain how each one addresses a specific problem previously identified. Relate each solution to its corresponding problem to show coherence.

#### 5.2. Scope and Exclusions

Clearly define what is included and what is not included in the proposal. List the aspects that are out of scope to avoid misunderstandings and properly manage expectations. Be transparent and specific in this section.

### 6. Conclusion

Summarize the key benefits of implementing the proposal and motivate the reader to consider the solution. End with a call to action or suggest the next steps to follow.

## Writing Tips

When drafting a project proposal, consider these tips to optimize its quality and effectiveness:

- **Clarity and Precision**: Use clear, direct, and unambiguous language. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon and ensure that anyone can understand the content, regardless of their previous experience.

- **Visual Structure**: Organize information using headings, subheadings, and lists to facilitate navigation and understanding of the document.

- **Focus on Value**: Highlight the concrete benefits the proposal brings to the target audience. Support your statements with clear examples and relevant data whenever possible.

- **Thorough Review**: Before submitting the proposal, carefully review spelling, grammar, and text coherence. Ensure the information is well-structured and relevant.

- **Audience Adaptation**: Customize the proposal according to the needs and characteristics of the recipient. Adjust the tone and content to maximize its impact and relevance.

- **Professional Format**: Present the proposal in a clean and professional format, ensuring it is easy to read and visually appealing through a consistent design.

- **Collaboration and Feedback**: If you work in a team, share the proposal to receive comments and suggestions. Integrate the feedback received to improve the content.

- **References and Resources**: Include, when relevant, links to additional resources, supporting documents, or examples that support the proposal and provide context.

- **Ask GitHub Copilot for Help**: If you have access to GitHub Copilot, use it to generate ideas, improve writing, or find relevant examples. This tool can be a great ally to optimize the proposal creation process.

- **Continuous Update**: Keep the proposal updated with recent and relevant information. Periodically review the content to ensure its validity and usefulness.

- **Professional Closure**: If you decide not to carry out the project, close the proposal professionally, explaining the reasons and thanking the reader for their time and consideration. This helps maintain a good relationship and opens the door to future collaborations.
