# Project Template v25.6.19

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

A base template to quickly and efficiently start software projects.

This template is designed to make it easier to create repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), simplifying the initial setup and promoting best practices from the very beginning.

Manually configuring a project can be repetitive and error-prone. That’s why this proposal offers a predefined structure with essential files, helping to optimize time and reduce possible mistakes.
