## Description

A base template to quickly and efficiently start software projects.

Setting up a project from scratch is often complex and repetitive, taking time away from real development. This base template streamlines the initial setup in **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, allowing teams to focus on creating quality solutions from the start.

## Key Features

- **Organized structure**: Predefined directories for efficient development.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed guides for every aspect of the project.
- **GitHub configuration**: Integration with workflows like GitHub Flow.
- **VS Code configuration**: Recommended settings and extensions included.
- **Kanban methodology**: Integrated visual tracking system.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted development methodology.
- **Code of Conduct**: Rules for a collaborative and respectful environment.
- **Collaboration**: Templates for contributions and clear policies.
- **Security**: Security policies and vulnerability reporting.
- **MIT License**: Free and open use under the MIT license.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- Basic software development knowledge.

## Quick Start

Get your project up and running in minutes by following these steps:

1. Click **Use this template** on the [project page](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-template) on GitHub, or clone the repository manually:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository and assign a name to your new project
   git clone https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-template.git my-project

   # Enter the project directory
   cd my-project

   # Open Visual Studio Code in the current directory
   code .

   # Initialize a new Git repository
   git init
   ```

2. **Review the [Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide** to get familiar with the template and learn the recommended workflow. If you already have experience, you can skip this step.

3. **Customize the documentation** according to your project's needs, or use the default version to start right away.

4. **Start developing** your application by applying the best practices and workflows recommended in the documentation.

That's it! You now have an environment ready for agile, efficient, and well-structured development.
